# Elm Starter Kit Generator

This library is a [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator that helps you easily start a new Elm Application.

By default, it generates a [Browser.application](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser#application) which is perfect for building an [spa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).

In the future, this generator will prodive more templates for starting other kind of programs (sandbox, element etc...)

Have [latest Elm version](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) installed

## Getting started

```
npm install -g yo
